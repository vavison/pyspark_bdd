# pyspark_bdd
Simple examples of using pytest-bdd to test scenarios in pyspark.

To run the tests in this project, you need to [install poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) and run `poetry install` to initialise the virtual environment.


Then you can run `poetry run pytest` and view the output of the BDD tests.
